> Concurrency is hard. Let's check out together how Kotlin attempts to tackle that in a practical way using their take on lightweight threads - the coroutines.

> Together, we'll follow a hands-on exercise, learning about:
> - suspend functions
> - using coroutines for concurrency
> - sharing data between coroutines using channels

> Tune in from the safety of your home on July 2nd for an evening broadcast and let Viktor lead you through this Kotlin coroutines hands-on. He will showcase his approach when learning new technologies, so it's definitely not to be missed! :)
